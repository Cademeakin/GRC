									<p>I have been waiting for this game for such a long time, as I am a huge Uncharted fan. I was worried that after all that time it might be a disappointment, rest assured it most definitely does not disappoint! I will say this it isn't as game changing as Uncharted 2: among thieves was at that games time of release, but it is definitely the best Uncharted game in the series. <br><br>

Let's talk graphics first: You have probably heard countless times about this games graphics, but I will say it has by far the best graphics I have ever seen full stop. The textures, the environments, the character models and pretty much everything else is jaw droppingly beautiful! Easily the best graphics I have ever seen full stop. <br><br>

The gameplay is seamless and enjoyable. It never gets boring. There is a perfect blend between shootouts, explosive set pieces and exploration. As for the latter this game demands exploration far more than any of the other games ever did, the environments are so open that you just want to explore and revel in the sheer beauty of it all. Not to mention to try and find the many scattered treasures and also find optional conversations (like in the last of us) and journal notes and entries. <br><br>

I will be honest there are not as many set pieces as in the previous two games, but if I am being honest that is actually and surprisingly a good thing. When I first heard that there wasn't as many set pieces as in the previous games I was disappointed, but the story and gameplay and exploration is what makes this game so great. However the set pieces which there are still plenty of are better than in the other games, they feel more seamless and unexpected than the previous games and makes you grin when you play through them. Also the car chase in Madagascar you saw in E3 is flipping spectacular to play yourself it will blow you through the rooftops. <br><br>

The story is also fantastic, you deeply care for all of the characters, the same can be said for all Uncharted games, but this ones make the characters especially Nathan Drake feel much more human. There are twists and turns and one especially that I never saw coming. I haven't completed the game yet, I am on level 20 of 22 so I am close enough that I can review the game properly, but I can't say how good (or bad) the ending is as I haven't quite experienced it yet. <br><br>

Finally the online multiplayer is also great fun and very well balanced. It envelops the feel of the single player campaign perfectly and is great team based fun. The only things that I am disappointed with is that there is no ranking points at all and there are no where near as many game modes as in Uncharted 3. There is no free for all, three team deathmatch, survivor mode. So for me that was very disappointing but what is there is phenomenal and will keep you entertained for hours. <br><br>

Also there is one easter egg at the very beginning of the game (Don't worry I will not spoil what it is) that if you are a long time Playstation or Naughty dog fan it will literally make your jaw drop to the floor in absolute delight and nostalgia. It also cannot be missed!</p>
